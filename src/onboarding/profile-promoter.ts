/**
 * Promotion path for LLM-generated selector profiles.
 *
 * Separated from `profile-generator.ts` so the generation module can
 * stay a pure, DB-free module that tests run cleanly under vitest
 * (vitest cannot load `bun:sqlite`). The promoter is DB-dependent and
 * is exercised by tests that initialize a real SQLite database.
 *
 * # Hard product invariant (do not break)
 *
 * AI-generated profiles **never** auto-promote. Promotion always
 * requires an explicit, per-selector-field approval object passed by a
 * human operator (typically via a review UI). Even with perfect
 * confidence, even with high validation, even when a field is
 * structurally simple, no field is written to `extractor_profiles`
 * without that operator-supplied approval. Images are especially
 * uncertain and require explicit opt-in.
 *
 * Approval is per field. The same generation row can be approved for
 * the title selector and rejected for the images selector in separate
 * calls. Each call writes only the fields explicitly set to `true` in
 * the approval object.
 *
 * Every approved field and every rollback produces a row in
 * `profile_generation_field_decisions` so the governance UI can show a
 * full per-field history with rollback capability.

 *   2. Writing that value (or null) into `extractor_profiles` for the
 *      target field only. Other selectors are untouched.
 *   3. Inserting a `rolled_back` decision row that links back to the
 *      approval that was reverted, so the governance UI can show the
 *      full lifecycle.
 *
 * If the decision ID is unknown, already rolled back, or the field has
 * changed since approval, the function still writes a `rolled_back`
 * decision row so the audit trail is complete; the caller can then
 * inspect the result to confirm the active profile state.
