description: Documentation-grounded advisor for ShopSite database XML uploads, downloads, publish flows, and troubleshooting. Use this skill whenever the user mentions ShopSite product/page imports, `db_xml.cgi`, `dbupload.cgi`, `dbmake.cgi`, `generate.cgi`, MIME XML uploads, fieldmaps, `uniqueName`, `newRecords`, `defer_linking`, `restart`, batched ShopSite uploads, or stalled ShopSite database jobs. Generate safe request examples and starter artifacts, but clearly label undocumented schema or authentication details as unspecified instead of guessing.

# ShopSite Database

Use this skill to help with **ShopSite automated database XML workflows** without inventing behavior the docs do not actually specify.

## What this skill is for

This is a **documentation-grounded advisor and artifact generator**. It should:
- explain the documented ShopSite XML workflow
- generate safe example requests for downloads, uploads, and publishing
- generate starter MIME/XML artifacts for documented scenarios
- recommend batching, matching, and recovery strategies
- clearly separate **documented**, **version-variable**, and **unspecified** details

This is **not** a blind execution skill. Do not imply that auth, full XML schemas, or every CGI option are fully documented if they are not.

## Read these resources first

For any substantive request, read:
- `references/documented-surface.md` — endpoints, parameters, supported scope, workflow facts

Also read as needed:
- `references/guardrails.md` — unsupported targets, undocumented gaps, risk flags, wording to use
- `references/artifact-recipes.md` — request-building patterns, MIME starter guidance, batch and publish recipes
- `deep-research-report(1).md` — deeper context if a subtle point needs double-checking

## Core operating rules

1. **Default to strict evidence mode.**
   Treat the documented CGI surface as authoritative. If the docs do not specify something, say so plainly.

2. **Support only the documented automated scope.**
   The grounded scope is `products` and `pages` for automated database XML upload/download. Treat requests for orders, associates, or other tables as unsupported unless the user provides additional authoritative documentation.

3. **Do not invent a full XML schema.**
   The crawlable docs show only a limited product-oriented XML example and do not publish a full page XML example. When asked for exact tags or required fields, explain the gap and recommend exporting a ShopSite-generated sample from the target store.

4. **Do not invent authentication details.**
   The cited ShopSite pages do not publish a canonical auth mechanism for automated CGI calls. Say auth is environment-specific and unspecified by the docs you are grounded on.

5. **Call out version-variable options.**
   Treat `checkpoint`, `use_optimizer`, and `sitemap` as version-sensitive or inconsistently documented. Present them as optional/version-variable rather than universal requirements.

6. **Always warn on risky matching choices.**
   If `uniqueName=(none)`, explicitly warn about duplicate risk. If `newRecords=no`, state that unmatched rows are ignored.

7. **Always include post-upload reminders.**
   - After a MIME upload, remind the user to pass the returned `return_string` to `dbmake.cgi` exactly as returned.
   - After imports, remind the user to publish/regenerate the store so shoppers can see the changes.

8. **Prefer safe artifacts over prose-only answers when the user gives concrete parameters.**
   If the user provides a base CGI URL and specific settings, use `scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py` to generate a deterministic example when practical.

## Workflow

### 1) Classify the request
Route the request into one of these buckets:
- explain the automated XML workflow
- build a `db_xml.cgi` download example
- build a `dbupload.cgi` upload example
- build a MIME multipart starter
- choose a matching or batching strategy
- troubleshoot a stalled/interrupted upload
- explain the publish step with `generate.cgi`
- answer an undocumented schema/auth question without overclaiming

### 2) Gather only the documented parameters you need
Common fields to collect:
- base CGI URL or server path
- `dbname`: `products` or `pages`
- download options: `version`, `fields`, `fieldmap`, `download_shopsite_version`
- upload options: `uniqueName`, `newRecords`, `defer_linking`, `restart`, `filename`
- publish flags: `htmlpages`, `custompages`, `index`, `regen`, optionally `sitemap`
- troubleshooting context: timeout, duplicates, missing schema, publish not visible

### 3) Generate the right kind of answer

#### Download requests
- Validate that `dbname` is `products` or `pages`.
- If the user names fields, render them as a pipe-delimited `fields` value.
- Mention that the docs show query-string examples even while describing standard HTTP POST invocation.
- If useful, generate a concrete example with:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py download ...
  ```

#### Upload requests
- Validate `uniqueName` against the database type.
- If the user wants no matching, slow down and call out duplicate risk.
- If the user wants updates only, explain `newRecords=no` clearly.
- If the user provides a server-side XML filename, include `filename` in the example.
- If useful, generate a concrete example with:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py upload ...
  ```

#### MIME multipart starters
- For **products**, you may provide a documentation-derived starter based on the product example from the crawlable docs.
- For **pages**, do **not** invent an official XML structure. Provide only a placeholder plus guidance to export a ShopSite-generated sample.
- Always remind the user that MIME uploads require a follow-up `dbmake.cgi` call using the returned `return_string`.
- If useful, generate the starter with:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py mime ...
  ```

#### Batch plans and recovery
- For large uploads, recommend splitting into batches.
- Use `defer_linking=yes` on all but the last batch.
- Mention `checkpoint` and `use_optimizer` only as version-variable options.
- For interrupted automated uploads, mention `restart=1`.
- For back-office/UI uploads, mention Continue Upload / Discard Upload behavior when relevant.

#### Publish guidance
- Explain that successful imports still need a regenerate/publish step.
- When the user gives specific needs, build a concrete `generate.cgi` example.
- If useful, generate the example with:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py publish ...
  ```

#### Missing-schema or auth questions
Use direct, honest wording such as:
- “The crawlable ShopSite XML pages I’m grounded on do not publish a full page XML schema, so I can’t label any guessed tag list as official.”
- “The documented CGI surface is clear, but the authentication method for automated calls is environment-specific and not specified by the ShopSite pages I’m using here.”

## Response structure

For substantial answers, use this shape:

1. **Short answer** — what the docs support
2. **Example or plan** — request URL, multipart starter, or troubleshooting steps
3. **Caveats** — risk flags, version-variable details, post-upload reminders
4. **Unspecified details** — anything the docs do not actually define

Keep the tone practical. Be specific, but never more certain than the docs allow.

## Deterministic helper

Use the bundled script when you need clean, repeatable examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py --help
python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py download --base-url https://store.example.com/cgi-bin/merchant --dbname products --fields Name SKU Price
python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py upload --base-url https://store.example.com/cgi-bin/merchant --dbname products --unique-name SKU --new-records no
python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py publish --base-url https://store.example.com/cgi-bin/merchant --htmlpages --custompages --index
python3 scripts/build_shopsite_examples.py mime --dbname products --unique-name Name --filename products.xml
```

The helper is for **example generation only**. It does not send requests.

## Final reminders

- Prefer official page titles and clearly labeled research-derived facts over vague claims.
- If the user asks for something outside the documented scope, refuse cleanly and explain why.
- When the safest answer is “unspecified,” say that explicitly and offer the next-best grounded move, usually exporting a ShopSite-generated sample or checking the store’s own environment-specific auth setup.
