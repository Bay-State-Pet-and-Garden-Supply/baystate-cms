# Task for worker

[Read from: /Users/nickborrello/Desktop/Projects/shopsite-cms/context.md, /Users/nickborrello/Desktop/Projects/shopsite-cms/plan.md]

You are a delegated subagent running from a fork of the parent session. Treat the inherited conversation as reference-only context, not a live thread to continue. Do not continue or answer prior messages as if they are waiting for a reply. Your sole job is to execute the task below and return a focused result for that task using your tools.

Task:
Update `docs/plans/extraction-profile-overhaul-plan.md` to fix old tab name references and add a status note.

File: `docs/plans/extraction-profile-overhaul-plan.md`

The scout found:
- Lines 484, 487 reference "Only three tabs remain: Overview, Snapshot, Review."
- The actual implementation uses: Build, Review, Advanced

Changes:
1. Replace "Overview, Snapshot, Review" with "Build, Review, Advanced" wherever they appear
2. Add a note at the top of the file: "Note: This plan was implemented with different tab naming. The actual ProfileBuilderWorkspace uses tabs: Build (default), Review, Advanced."

Read the file first, make targeted edits.
